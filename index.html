               <p>
                  PlayerUnknown Battlegrounds (PUBG) has been an extremely popular game globally
                  since last year. We are  two of the millions of fans of the game and we decided
                  to make some cool visualization based on the data of the game.
                  <br> <br>
                  The game is an online multi-player battle royal game, where 100 random players are
                  dispersed from a plane to an isolated island to fight and kill. From the first moment
                  of playersâ€™ landing, they move around in this space to pick up weapons and supplies so that
                  when they meet other players they are in a better shape to fight. As time goes by in the game,
                  the arena shrinks which forces the players to enter a smaller space and fight.
                  Intuitively, the last player stays alive is the winner.
                  <br><br>Below is a map from the game to give you some sense of the rules.
                  The circle is where players are allowed to move without causing any damage.
                  And the right hand side is the view from any player
                  <br><br>

                  <br><br>
                  Strategy about choosing location is very important in this game.
                  The biggest motivation of this project is to learn from the player behavior and
                  understand the strategy players adopt.
                  <br><br>
                  We are glad to find the data we need from kaggle.
                  This public kaggle dataset contains information about 720,000 competitive matches
                  extracted from  pubg.op.gg, a game tracker website
                  <br><br>
                  Please feel free to explore the visualization tabs to interact with the data!

               <p>In the below 3D network, we randomly chose one match and visualize the victims - all the players
                  except the top 1 winner, and their corresponding killer. Each dot represents one player and darker
                  color means higher rank
